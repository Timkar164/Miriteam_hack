Good evening! Have you been to our café before?\No, it’s our first time.
Let me bring you something to drink first. It’s on the house. What would you like: tea, coffee, orange juice, apple juice, red wine, white wine...?\I will have red wine, thank you. What about you, dear?
Me too. I already like this place!\What are you doing?
